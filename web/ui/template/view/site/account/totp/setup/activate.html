	<p>Once two-factor authentication has been enabled you'll be required to provide a 6 digit passcode to verify your identity when logging in.</p>
	<p>In the event that you lose access to your authentication device you can use the following recovery codes in place of a normal passcode.</p>

	<div class="warning-banner">
		<p>Before enabling two-factor authentication, please download, print, copy, or photograph your recovery codes and store them in a safe place separate from your authentication device.</p>
		<p>
			If possible, we recommend storing them in a password manager, such as
			<a href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1Password</a>,
			<a href="https://www.lastpass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LastPass</a>, or
